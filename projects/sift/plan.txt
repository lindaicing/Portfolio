This file should hold our plan.

Name: Sift

Research: "Walter Burke Barbe and colleagues proposed three learning modalities (often identified by the acronym VAK)."
These include the Visualising, Auditory, and Kinesthetic modalities. We want to develop a site that allows a user to search for terms, and have the results be presented according to their preferred learning modality.
Our product is named Sift, which references the "sifting" of information. It is also an acronym for "Styles in Finding Things."

Audience: Our audience are college students that don't learn well in traditional classroom lecture environments, or want to conduct further research on topics that accomodate to their particular learning styles.
