This web application was created for Cal Hacks 2019 (October 25 - 27). Our goal was to develop a platform to more effectively gather educational resources. We were inspired by the chance to develop a tool that we would enjoy using. In our own lives, we've found that while there are usually really good articles and sources, often times it helps to draw from a variety of sources, approaching topics from different perspectives and approaches is a crucial step in the learning process.
