                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The Hard Tech Fund (HTF) began as a startup accelerator and development program that assists UC Davis student projects that build hardware with environmental conservation in mind. Eventually it became a non-profit, and the student
                        organization became "Hard Tech Campus" (HTC).</p>
                    <p>My role in this project was creating the website layout, branding, logos, illustrations, flyers, and other visual marketing materials to promote the Hard Tech Fund, its associated projects, and its mission.</p>

                    <h3>Hard Tech Fund</h3>
                    <h4>Logo</h4>
                    <p>The HTF logo is very similar to the HTC logo, except that the surrounding form is hexagonal, to represent a hardware nut instead of a leaf. This is because although the Hard Tech Fund values sustainability, the projects it is involved
                        in emphasises the hardware aspect more.</p>

                    <h3>Hard Tech Campus</h3>
                    <h4>Logo and Branding</h4>
                    <p>Since the Hard Tech Fund values sustainability and hardware, the logo takes the imagery of a leaf and combines it with the "on" symbol, which references hardware. The fonts chosen were Saira Semi-Condensed (for its angular tech-like
                        appearance as a display font) and Roboto Light (for its easy readability). The images used were open-sourced (more information in footer) and modified with filters to fit the branding. A brainstorm session and word association activity was first completed to clarify the intentions and goals of HTC.</p>
