                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>For our research we created and sent out a google survey with over 70 responses that researched eating habits during COVID. Our responses were varied but we managed to survey a significant amount of people in our target demographic,
                        which is people aged 35 and up.</p>
                    <p>Our primary demographic consists of people with an established income, who want to show their loved ones (particularly their parents) that they are thinking of them in these trying times. We particularly wanted to address senior loneliness
                        and assist local businesses who we plan to partner with in our program.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>94% of people get their food from going in person to the grocery store</li>
                        <li>37% of people use meal delivery services such as Uber Eats, Postmates, Grubhub</li>
                        <li>5.7% of people use meal delivery kits such as Blue Apron, Hello Fresh</li>
                        <li>38.9% of people get restaurant delivered meals at least weekly</li>
                        <li>95.7% laptop/desktop users</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What does this mean? We planned to create a web application that both seniors and their younger loved ones can use, to plan the meal delivery and to really show their seniors they care!</p>

                    <h3>Approach and Research</h3>
                    <p>We chose the name Clove because cloves are a prominent cooking spice, and they symbolize friendships and positive attention. We like to think we’re putting the “love” in “clove.”</p>
