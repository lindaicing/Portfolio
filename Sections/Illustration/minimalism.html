    <h2>Background and Audience</h2>
    <section> <!-- Background and Audience -->
      <p>The project is about the practice of minimalism, specifically how it relates to a sustainable lifestyle and how people can approach this practice. Minimalism, or the interest in keeping things simple and meaningful, is a practice that is anti-consumerist and decluttering what is not necessary in our lives. Not only does the concept of minimalism promote the decrease of unsustainable goods like plastic and unnecessary clutter, it advocates the appreciation of the goods that we do have. The project is viewable on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Nmr6oPi1M" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and here:</p>

    <section> <!-- Research -->
      <h2>Research and Impact</h2>
      <p>An example of minimalism is if someone buys only one drinking mug. Unlike people who use tons of paper cups or even people who have multiple mugs, they don’t have to worry about keeping track of multiple mugs, about doing extra dishes, or about using and tossing so many paper cups. The one mug for them is enough, and they live a less cluttered and more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
      <p>The primary audiences are young adults. The hope is that they will take on these habits and practice them so they will live easier and more meaningful lives, and benefit society in the long run. The secondary audiences are young kids. If parents of young kids take notice of the message of this project, the hope is that they will practice minimalism habits with their kids and teach them how to live more sustainable lifestyles. In urban areas, minimal living is especially useful, since if can reduce the amount of material goods that people have, which can benefit both hygiene and a person’s mental state.</p>

    <section> <!-- Development -->
      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>The goal of the project was to explain the concept of minimalism, then specifically define how it makes a lifestyle sustainable and give brief examples of how to start living minimally. After that, the project gave examples of this kind of practice and noted how it would benefit the lives of the audience.</p>
